# Intro to DSA
## What is DSASG?
The Data Structures & Algorithms Study Group was formed as a hub for developers to learn about and discuss the fundamental computer science concepts and topics surrounding data structures and algorithms.
## What is DSA?
DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It is a fundamental concept in computer science that deals with the systematic organization, management, storage, and retrieval of data in a way that enables efficient access and modification. DSA is crucial in the field of computer science because it provides a framework for designing and analyzing software and hardware systems. A good understanding of DSA is essential for writing efficient programs that can handle large amounts of data and complex operations without compromising on performance.
## Core DS
Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. 
### Data structures
- Linked list
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary tree
- Binary search tree
- Heap
- Hash table
- Graph
- Trie
## Core algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. They are the methods or processes used to perform operations on data structures, from simple tasks like searching and sorting to more complex operations like graph traversals and dynamic programming.
### Algorithms
- Bellman-Ford algorithm
- Binary search
- Bread-first search
- Depth-first search
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Divide & Conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- Hashing
- Kadane's algorithm
- Manachers algorithm
- Prims algorithm
- Quicksort
- Sliding window
- Two pointer
## Where is DSA?
- **Google Maps and GPS Navigation:**
  - **Graphs:** The underlying data structure for representing the map is a graph. Locations are represented as nodes, and roads are represented as edges connecting these nodes. Algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* are used to find the shortest path between two points.
  - **Priority Queues (Min-Heaps):** These are used in conjunction with pathfinding algorithms to efficiently find the next best node to explore.

- **Social Media Platforms (Facebook, Twitter):**
  - **Graphs:** Social networks use graph data structures to represent users as nodes and connections/friendships/followers as edges. Algorithms traverse these graphs for features like "People You May Know" or to display the network of friends.
  - **Hash Tables:** They are used to handle massive datasets and to quickly retrieve user profiles, posts, and other information through hashing.

- **Database Management Systems (MySQL, MongoDB):**
  - **B-Trees and B+ Trees:** These data structures are used for indexing, which allows for quick data retrieval in relational databases.
  - **Red-Black Trees:** Some databases use self-balancing binary search trees like red-black trees to keep the data sorted and to allow for quick search, insert, and delete operations.

- **E-commerce Websites (Amazon, eBay):**
  - **Search Algorithms:** To sort and search through product listings quickly, algorithms like quicksort or mergesort are used.
  - **Caching:** Data structures like LRU (Least Recently Used) caches, implemented via a combination of hash maps and doubly-linked lists, are commonly used for fast data retrieval.

- **Streaming Services (Netflix, Spotify):**
  - **Tries:** Data structures like tries are used for type-ahead search suggestions as you start typing in the search bar.
  - **Recommendation Algorithms:** Algorithms leveraging data structures like matrices (for matrix multiplication in collaborative filtering) or heaps for managing top-rated shows or songs.

- **Operating Systems:**
  - **Queues:** Used in managing process scheduling.
  - **Trees:** File systems are often structured as trees, with directories as nodes and files as leaves.

- **Search Engines (Google, Bing):**
  - **Inverted Indices:** Implemented using hash maps and lists, they are used to index web pages and provide quick search results.
  - **PageRank Algorithm:** Google's famous algorithm for ranking web pages in search results, which uses a graph data structure.

- **Content Delivery Networks (Cloudflare, Akamai):**
  - **Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs):** For efficient resource location in a distributed network, which is crucial for load balancing and data caching in CDNs.

## LeetCode
LeetCode is an online platform designed primarily for software engineers to:
- practice their coding skills
- prepare for technical interviews
- tackle algorithmic challenges
LeetCode offers a vast collection of coding problems from various domains of computer science, including data structures and algorithms. Each problem is accompanied by a problem statement, example cases, and a discussion board where users can interact, share solutions, and learn different approaches to problem-solving. The problems presented on LeetCode are very similar to what you would expect to see in a live coding technical job interview for a FAANG or FAANG-like company.

**Motivation**

This study group is dedicated to learning about data structures and algorithms for increasing awareness, ability, and proficiency toward technical job interviews.

Core resources used by the study group include the MIT DSA course on YouTube, the Grokking the coding interview patterns (just the patterns, not the book/course), and the LeetCode problems isolated by Grind75. Any and all other resources are completely acceptable and encouraged. The aforementioned resources will simply be the primary drivers for the topics focused on by the study group each week. Understanding the major DSA concepts outlined within the resources has proven to be beneficial for improving a developer's ability to solve LeetCode problems. This is because understanding the overarching DSA concepts, such as BFS, results in the ability to solve multiple LeetCode (and DSA in general) problems.
